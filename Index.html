                fifth
                birthday expressed per 1,000 live births.</h3>

                especially
                with regards to regional inequality. </h3>
            <h4>Rural society in China comprises of almost half of their population,
                approximately 45%. Yet, in 2019 the child mortality rate in rural areas was more than<strong> TWO
                </strong>times that of

            <h1><strong>Why is this happening?</strong></h1>
            <h3>The major reason for this difference can be revealed through the disparity between medical
                infrastructures within rural and urban China. In particular, rural patients face barriers to equal

                In 2019 there were less than half as many health technical personnel, licensed physicians and

                This leads to understaffed and unequipped health clinics. Furthermore, many village clinics are limited
                in their ability to operate in this primary care role due to a lack of both training and compensation
                for physicians (Liang, Macinko, Yue & Meng, 2019).

                This continues the cycle of physician distrust and force patients to go directly to Tier II and Tier III
                hospitals which are usually located further away and more costly.
